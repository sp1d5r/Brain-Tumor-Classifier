# Brain Tumor Classifier

I want to make a lung cancer classifier, but I couldn't find a decent dataset. Also my computer doesn't 
have a ton of memory left from other projects I've been building. So while I wait for my virtual machine 
to get ready I will do some practice on this brain tumor dataset.

The dataset can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/navoneel/brain-mri-images-for-brain-tumor-detection).

The dataset is considerably small. There are only 3250 images in total, there are four different types of brain tumors
recorded - glioma tumor, meningioma tumor, and pituitary tumor. As a control group I've got a no tumor group. If you 
look at the files you'll be able to see an obvious difference between the MRI scans with a brain tumor and the ones 
without, but because i don't have any knowledge on what it's supposed to look like i'm not sure how long it will take.
